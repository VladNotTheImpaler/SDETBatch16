Important things to Keep in mind for this course:
    1) Pay attention during the class.

    It`s a must that you go through those slides and watch in the
    courseAnnouncement channel.
    3) A lot of Practice
    4) When practicing if you face any issues don`t spend more than 15

Why we are here?
    1) To be automation engineers.
What do automation engineers do?
    They test software ,but mainly you will be testing websites and mobile
    apps by writing a piece of software that will test the websites
    automatically.
Why are we learning java?
        Java is a programming language that we will be using to communicate
        with the computer so that we can guide a computer orn how to test
        a website automatically.
How Programming languages work?
    They work in a very similar fashion just like human languages work.
    They have grammar rules, vocabulary punctuation etc.
    In this part of course we will be learning there rules for java
What is intellij?
    IntelliJ is a software that we will be using to write java code just like
    we use Microsoft Word to write English. It has many features like it can
    find and fix issues in our code. It can suggest improvements. it can assist
    you to organize your code and so many other things.

What is a project in intelliJ?
    A project is nothing but a folder that we create to organize our code just
    like we create folders on our computers to organize files.
How to create a project?
    1) File=>New=>Project.
    2) Once you follow the above steps you will see a pop.
    3) Provide the name for the project and click on create.
What is a package?
    A package is nothing but another folder inside the project folder we create
    packages to organize code.
How can i create a package?
    1) Right-click on SRC folder => New => Package
    2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name for the package
How to create Notes.txt file?
    1) Right-click on SRC folder => New => File
    2)Once the pop-up appears enter the name of the file and the extension .txt
What is a class?
    1) Right-click on the package = . New => Java Class
    2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name for class.
    Classes follow a convention that first letter of all the words should
    be in upper case and there can't be any spaces between words.
Some shortcuts to write code quickly;
    1)To create the main method we just write "main" and hit the enter
    button or the tab button and intellij will automatically write a
    method for you.
    2) To print something on the console we write "sout" and hit
    the enter button or the tab button, and it should auto complete
    the print statement for you.
