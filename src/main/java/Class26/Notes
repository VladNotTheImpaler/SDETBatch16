Three Main Types of maps:
    1)HashMap 2)LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap.
HashMap:
    Best overall performance, but it does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashMap:
    It maintains the insertion order. A little slow then the HashMap.
TreeMap:
    It sorts the data based on keys. it's slower than HashMap and LinkedHashMap.
